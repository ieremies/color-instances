[[./lit/hoeve21-table1.csv]] has the comparison between the relaxed and exact decision diagram (the former performs better).
[[./lit/hoeve21-table2.csv]] has the best results they could manage with different configurations. Also, it serves as a benchmark for the results of the DSATUR heuristic.
[[./lit/hoeve21-table3.csv]] has the comparison between the [cite:@Held12] of [cite:@Mehrotra96] and their best configuration.

Relaxed Diagram can find optimal in more instances in less time (table 1).
The best ordering are the Max-Connected-Degree and DSATUR ordering (table 2).
They also ran the [cite:@Held12] implementation on they machine: Held's solves more instances to optimal, but DD can return an LB in all instances.
  # TODO mas esse LB Ã© melhor que o cliquer?

Their results where obtained on a Intel Xeon E5345 @ 2.33 Ghz
** [cite:@Heule22]
Uses an alternating Max Clique and Graph Coloring SAT solvers.
The reported time is the average of 128 seeds on a AMD EPYC 7742.
Using an Intel Xeon @ 2.33GHz, they proved optimal for 83 instances.
